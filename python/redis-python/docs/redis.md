## What is Redis?

Redis (Remote Dictionary Server) is an in-memory data structure store used as a database, cache, and message broker. It supports various data structures such as strings, hashes, lists, sets, and more.

### Real-World Examples:

1. **Caching**: Redis is often used to cache frequently accessed data to improve application performance. For example, caching user session data in a web application.
2. **Real-Time Analytics**: Redis can be used to store and analyze real-time data, such as tracking user activity on a website.
3. **Message Queues**: Redis can act as a message broker, handling tasks like job queues in background processing systems.
4. **Leaderboard**: In gaming applications, Redis can be used to maintain real-time leaderboards due to its fast read and write operations.

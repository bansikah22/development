## Understanding Abbreviations in the Document

Below are key abbreviations found in the Berlin Group OpenFinance API Framework - Core-PSD2 Compliance V2 Suite - Consent API document, along with their meanings and examples based on the document:

### **PSU (Payment Service User)**

Refers to an individual or business using a payment service.  
Example: A bank customer (PSU) grants consent to an AISP to access their account details.

### **AIS (Account Information Service)**

A service that allows access to a user's account information.  
Example: A PSU consents to an AISP retrieving their account balance and transaction history.

### **AISP (Account Information Service Provider)**

A third-party provider that retrieves account information on behalf of a PSU.  
Example: A fintech company offering financial insights by accessing a user's multiple bank accounts.

### **PIS (Payment Initiation Service)**

A service that initiates a payment transaction from a PSU’s account.  
Example: A PSU authorizes a PISP to initiate a bank transfer for an online purchase.

### **PISP (Payment Initiation Service Provider)**

A third-party provider that can initiate payments from a PSU’s account.  
Example: A mobile payment app initiating a transaction on behalf of a PSU.

### **PIISP (Payment Instrument Issuing Service Provider)**

A provider that issues payment instruments and requests confirmation of funds before processing transactions.  
Example: A prepaid card provider checking a PSU’s account balance before authorizing a transaction.

### **ASPSP (Account Servicing Payment Service Provider)**

A financial institution that holds PSU accounts and provides APIs for third-party providers (TPPs).  
Example: A bank providing APIs for AISPs and PISPs to access PSU account information securely.

### **TPP (Third-Party Provider)**

Example: An AISP retrieving account data or a PISP initiating payments.

### **FCS (Funds Confirmation Service)**

A service where a PIISP verifies if sufficient funds are available in a PSU’s account.  
Example: A card issuer requesting confirmation before approving a transaction.

### **XS2A (Access to Account)**

A PSD2-mandated framework allowing TPPs to access bank accounts with PSU consent.  
Example: A PSU allowing a budgeting app (AISP) to fetch their account balance via an XS2A interface.

### **SCA (Strong Customer Authentication)**

A security requirement ensuring user authentication through multi-factor methods.  
Example: A PSU verifying their identity using a password and a mobile OTP before approving a transaction.

### **OAuth2 (Open Authorization 2.0)**

A standard authentication protocol used to secure API access.  
Example: A PSU granting a fintech app (TPP) access to their banking data using OAuth2 authentication.

### Implementation of **validTo** in Version 2

`validTo` is used to define the expiration date of a consent request.  
It is a mandatory field in the consent request body.  
Format: ISODate (YYYY-MM-DD)  
If a future date is set, the ASPSP may adjust it based on policy.  
Example in JSON request:
```json
"validTo": "2024-11-01"
```
### Class Names for Code Implementation
If implementing this in code, the following class names could be used based on the document:
```bash
ConsentRequest
ConsentResponse
AccountAccessConsent
FundsConfirmationConsent
UserParameterConsent
DocumentServiceConsent
ConsentStatus
```
These classes would represent different types of consents and their lifecycle statuses.

### Endpoint URLs Structure
Based on the document, the API follows a RESTful structure with versioning (v2) and resource categories (consents). The endpoint URLs will look like this:

#### Creating a Consent
```bash
POST /v2/consents/account-access
POST /v2/consents/funds-confirmations
POST /v2/consents/user-parameters-access
POST /v2/consents/document-services
```
Used to create consent resources for different service types.

#### Fetching Consent Details
```bash
GET /v2/consents/account-access/{consentId}
GET /v2/consents/funds-confirmations/{consentId}
GET /v2/consents/user-parameters-access/{consentId}
GET /v2/consents/document-services/{consentId}
```
Retrieves consent details using consentId.

#### Fetching Consent Status
```bash
GET /v2/consents/{consent-category}/{consentId}/status
```
Returns the status of the consent resource.

#### Deleting/Revoking a Consent
```bash
DELETE /v2/consents/{consent-category}/{consentId}
```
Terminates a specific consent.

### Class Naming Convention
If implementing this API in a structured way, the following class names could be used:

#### Model Classes (Representing API Entities)
- `ConsentRequest` (General representation of consent requests)
- `ConsentResponse` (Response model for consent creation)
- `AccountAccessConsent` (Specific for account access consent)
- `FundsConfirmationConsent` (For fund confirmation consents)
- `UserParameterConsent` (For user parameters access consent)
- `DocumentServiceConsent` (For document-related consent)

#### Service Classes (Handling Business Logic)
- `ConsentService` (Handles general consent operations)
- `AccountAccessConsentService` (Handles account access-related logic)
- `FundsConfirmationService` (Handles funds confirmation requests)
- `UserParameterService` (Manages user parameter consents)
- `DocumentServiceConsentService` (Handles document-related consents)

#### Controller Classes (Handling API Endpoints)
- `ConsentController` (General consent operations)
- `AccountAccessConsentController`
- `FundsConfirmationController`
- `UserParameterConsentController`
- `DocumentServiceConsentController`

These names align with RESTful API practices and keep the implementation structured.

## A Map
- A map is a collection of key-value pairs.
- Each key is unique and maps to a single value.
- The key is used to retrieve the value.
- The value can be any object.
- The map interface provides three collection views:
  - `Key Set`: A set of unique keys.
  - `Value Set`: A collection of values.
  - `Entry Set`: A set of key-value pairs.
  - The map interface provides methods to:
    - Add key-value pairs.
    - Remove key-value pairs.
    - Retrieve values by key.
    - Check if a key or value exists.
    - Iterate over key-value pairs.
    - Get the size of the map.
    - Check if the map is empty.
    - Clear the map.
    - Perform bulk operations like putAll and removeAll.
    - Get the hash code of the map.
  - The map interface does not extend the Collection interface.
  - The map interface provides several implementations:
    - `HashMap`: Provides a hash table implementation of the Map interface.
    - `LinkedHashMap`: Provides a hash table and linked list implementation of the Map interface.
    - `TreeMap`: Provides a red-black tree implementation of the Map interface.
    - `EnumMap`: Provides a specialized Map implementation for enum types.
    - `WeakHashMap`: Provides a hash table implementation with weak keys.
    - `IdentityHashMap`: Provides a hash table implementation with reference-equality in place of object-equality.
    - `ConcurrentHashMap`: Provides a thread-safe implementation of the Map interface.
    - `ConcurrentSkipListMap`: Provides a thread-safe implementation of the NavigableMap interface.
    - `Properties`: Extends Hashtable and represents a persistent set of properties.
  
### Use cases
- Storing and retrieving key-value pairs.
- Implementing data structures like dictionaries, hash tables, and associative arrays.
- Implementing algorithms like memoization, caching, and counting frequencies.
- Managing configuration settings in applications.
- Storing and processing data in web applications, such as user preferences, session data, and application state.

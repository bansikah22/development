## A linked List
- A linked list is a `linear data structure` where elements are stored in nodes.
- Each node consists of two parts: `data` and a `reference` to the next node.
- The first node is called the `head`, and the last node is called the `tail`.
- The `tail node` points to null, indicating the end of the list.
- A linked list can be singly linked, doubly linked, or circular linked.
- A singly linked list has nodes that point to the next node.
- A doubly linked list has nodes that point to the next and previous nodes.
- A circular linked list has nodes that form a circular loop.
- Linked lists are dynamic and can grow or shrink during program execution.
- Linked lists are slower than arrays for data retrieval but faster for insertion and deletion.
- Linked lists are used to implement other data structures like stacks, queues, and graphs.

### Use cases
- Storing and manipulating data
- Implementing data structures like stacks, queues, and graphs
- Implementing algorithms like sorting, searching, and graph traversal
- Managing data in web applications, such as storing user information, shopping cart items, and comments
- Implementing data caching and session management in web servers
- Storing and processing data in enterprise applications, such as employee records, customer details, and product information

### Inheritance in java

- Done using the `extends` keyword
- In the constructor of every class that inherits the parent class we have the `super` also making sure that all the attributes of the parent class are extended and inherited
- We can override methods using the `override` annotation
- Is a property of OOP

- Run the code
```java
cd inheritance
javac *.java
java Main
```
